## Environment Setup

Visit [php.new](https://php.new/) and select your specific operating system.

Follow the instructions on the site to install everything needed for Laravel development.

Next visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) and download version `v22.11.0(LTS)` for your specific operating system.

## Troubleshooting

If you face issues running the Laravel dev server, you may need to change your `php.ini` file.

Change the line `variables_order = "EGPCS"` to `variables_order = "GPCS"`.

You can find the `php.ini` file in this path on windows: `C:\Users\<USER>\.config\herd-lite\bin\php.ini`.
