## Environment Setup

Visit [php.new](https://php.new/) and select your specific operating system.

Follow the instructions on the site to install everything needed for Laravel development.

If you face issues running the Laravel dev server, you may need to change your `php.ini` file.

Change the line `variables_order = "EGPCS"` to `variables_order = "GPCS"`.

You can find the `php.ini` file in this path on windows: `C:\Users\<USER>\.config\herd-lite\bin\php.ini`.
